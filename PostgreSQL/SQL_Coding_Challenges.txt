1. Create a table Employees and insert five records into it:

EmployeeID
Firstname
Lastname
Department
Salary
ReportsTo (references EmployeeID)

===========================================================================

2. 3 tables:

table 1: Mr. Johnson
table 2: Ms. Mary
table 3: Ms. Angela

5 records per table: 
ID, firstname, lastname, grade

Output all the records from all tables with an added column for 'teacher'.

Table1:
101	John	Smith	G1

Table2:
201	Mary	Jerry	G2

Table3:
301	Joe	Kemp	G3

Output:
101	John	Smith	G1	Mr. Johnson
201	Mary	Jerry	G2	Ms. Mary
301	Joe	Kemp	G3	Ms. Angela

======================================================================

3. We have 2 tables with the following schema:

    Employees                       Departments
Fields     | DataTypes          Fields  | DataTypes
-----------+-----------        ---------+-----------
Emp_ID     | INT                Dept_ID | INT
FirstName  | VARCHAR(255)       Name    | VARCHAR(255)
LastName   | VARCHAR(255)
Dept_ID    | INT

Using SQL, how do we output each person's first and last name and the department they work for?
The output should be displayed in alphabetical order by first name, then by last name.

========================================================================

4. We have a table in MySQL with the following schema:

Employees:
Fields		| Datatypes
----------------+-------------
Name		| VARCHAR(255)	
Emp_ID		| INT		
Dept		| VARCHAR(255)	
No_of_years	| INT		
Salary		| INT		

Using SQL, find the average salary of the employees
per department and per how many years they worked.

======================================================================

5. 3 Tables:

Departments:
Fields	   | Datatypes
-----------+--------------
dept_ID    | INT
dept_name  | VARCHAR(255)

Employees:
Fields	    | Datatypes
------------+--------------
first_name  | VARCHAR(255)
last_name   | VARCHAR(255)
dept_ID     | INT

Managers:
Fields      | Datatypes
------------+--------------
first_name  | VARCHAR(255)
last_name   | VARCHAR(255)
dept_ID     | INT

   Query the names of all currently working managers,
   the department they manage,
   and the number of employees that currently work in their departments.

Output:
dept_no		dept_name	first_name	last_name	No_Employees
d001		Sales		Bob		Ross		2342

(Series of questions)
Read each of the following steps and write a script to simulate that instruction in your database.

Create a table named inventory with the following fields.

ID (number)
name (varchar)
price (number; choose a type that supports at least two decimal places)
description (varchar)
quantity (number)

Insert the following records to your table so that it looks like the following:

ID	NAME			PRICE	DESCRIPTION					QUANTITY
1001	Hershey Bar		3.45	A small chocolate bar				50
1002	Skittles		3.05	A bag of rainbow colored candies		100
2003	Gummy Bears		5.55	A large bag of chewy fruit-flavored bears	48
2005	Sour Gummy Worms	9.55	A very large bag of gelatin worms		20
3008	Lollipop		2.25	A hard candy atop a stick			268
9007	M&Ms			1.95	A bag of small chocolate candies		58

Then do the following:
- Run a query to read and display all records in our table

- A customer has just purchased 2 Hershey Candy Bars. Update the inventory to be 48 now.

- Run a query to return only the descriptions of all records in the table.

- A customer wants to see all items in your store and their prices.

- Run a query to return the name and price only of all records in the table.

- Change the description of the Sour Gummy Worms to be 'A very large, delicious bag of worms'.

- You've received a shipment of M&Ms just now! Update the quantity to 100.

- You are getting a lot of demand for lollipops. Update the price to $2.50.

- What is the total cost to purchase all remaining M&Ms in your store?

- Run a query to return the name and price of the candy item that costs the least amount of money.

- Run a query to return the candy item with the largest quantity in inventory. Return just the name and the quantity left.

- Run a query to return the 3 most expensive candy items. Return all columns.
